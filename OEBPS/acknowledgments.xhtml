      <p>Thanks to my wife, Elizabeth, for reading the first draft of this book and giving invaluable advice that set the course for what it would become. Also thanks to my wonderful accountants at Curry, Drake &amp; Associates and Dan Small in particular for reading and providing valuable feedback on the more technical aspects of the accounting nature of the book. I’m sure I’d be in jail by now if it weren’t for them (for unintentional reasons of course). </p>
      <p>Also thanks to those who read drafts of the book and provided feedback: Chris Davis, Jordan Koschei, and Robert Sagers.</p>
