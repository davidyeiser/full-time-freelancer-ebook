      <p>The numbers for the two categories covered here were significant enough to warrant a quick explanation.</p>
      <h3>Tithes</h3>
      <p>When I first started freelancing I made a personal decision to tithe<sup>1</sup> a percentage of my business revenue. Later I decided to keep my tithes separate as something I do with my personal income. If you do decide to do something like this with your business income versus your personal income just be aware of the legal conditions for doing so.</p>
      <h3>Donations</h3>
      <p>Donations can be made through your company but there are rules and regulations surrounding it. I didn&#8217;t do this much but if you start to bring in large profits it may be something to consider.</p>
